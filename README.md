## About Me
I am currently pursuing a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science at Metropolitan State University of Denver, with an anticipated graduation date of Spring 2025. My academic journey is complemented by practical experience and a strong project management and web development background.

 During my tenure as a Project Manager at Colorado Space Grant, I first managed a team that assisted with the launching and recovery of high-altitude balloons and, later, ground station satellite communication. I honed my leadership and project management skills over two years. This role provided me with invaluable insights into managing complex projects, the importance of good documentation, and collaborating with diverse teams.

 While taking a few years off for family commitments around the beginning of COVID, I dedicated myself to learning web development, focusing on technologies such as MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, and NodeJS. This self-directed learning has equipped me with the skills to build robust and dynamic web applications.

 Currently, I am part of the Faculty Engagement and Experiential Learning team within Career Services at MSU Denver. I have successfully reworked student database systems in this role, emphasizing data standardization and enhancing connections between data in different departments. My work has contributed to more efficient data management and improved student support services.

 My career aspirations include web development, project management, or software documentation roles. I am eager to leverage my technical skills and managerial experience to contribute to innovative projects and teams.
